class QuantumSystem:
    """Base class for quantum systems providing common simulation functionality.

    This class serves as the foundation for specific quantum system implementations,
    offering methods for parallel quantum system evolution and state processing.
    It supports both master equation and SchrÃ¶dinger equation evolution using
    QuTiP's solvers.

    Attributes:
        diag_hamiltonian (qutip.Qobj): Diagonalized Hamiltonian of the system.
        products_to_keep (List[List[int]]): List of product states to keep in the
            truncated Hilbert space.
        product_to_dressed (dict): Mapping from product states to dressed states.
        qbt_position (int): Position of the qubit in the product state indices.
