# CoupledQuantumSystems
```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/JiakaiW/CoupledQuantumSystems
```
### Note that this is primarily for personal use. Structure is not quite organized. 

## Features:
1. Abstract and facilitate the common workflows in dealing with coupled systems (particularly fluxonium)
2. Heavily uses numpy to deal with manipulations of qutip.qobj


## TODO:
1. implement product state to dressed state assignment by adiabatically turning on the coupling.
