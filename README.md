(text in green means that feature is not fully implemented)

### Note that this is primarily for personal use. Structure is not quite organized. (may call it early alpha)

## Features:
1. Abstract and facilitate the common workflows in dealing with coupled systems (particularly fluxonium)
2. Heavily uses numpy to deal with manipulations of qutip.qobj
